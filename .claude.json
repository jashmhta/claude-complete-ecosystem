Superadmin Control Panel\n    •    A centrally controlled Superadmin account should oversee all client hospitals or clinics using the software.\n    •    The Superadmin can:\n    •    View a comprehensive list of all active users/accounts.\n    •    Enable or disable specific modules (e.g., OPD, IPD, Diagnostics, Pharmacy, Accounting) per user/hospital based on their subscription tier.\n    •    Create and assign accounts manually, as account creation should be centrally controlled (not self-registered).\n    •    Define the maximum number of users allowed per account based on the plan.\n    •    Allow users to reset passwords locally, while still maintaining centralized control over new account creation and module access.\n\n2. Access-Controlled Features\n    •    Specific actions such as applying discounts on invoices should be restricted based on user roles (e.g., only Admin or Manager-level users can apply discounts).\n    •    All access privileges should be customizable under Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).\n\n3. Quick Price Estimator Tool\n    •    A “Quick Price Estimation” button should be available on the dashboard to generate an estimated cost for any combination of services (OPD consultation, tests, surgeries, room charges, etc.).\n    •    This is especially useful for front-desk staff when counseling patients on expected costs.\n\n4. Advanced Accounting System\n    •    Tally Integration: The system must integrate seamlessly with Tally Prime for accounting, GST compliance, and report generation.\n    •    Export to Excel: All financial records and reports must be exportable in .xls format for independent review or third-party processing.\n    •    Referral Income Tracking:\n    •    Income from patient referrals (e.g., from doctors, agents, or clinics) should be tracked and reported separately.\n    •    Outsourced Service Accounting:\n    •    Services outsourced to third parties (like MRI scans, pathology tests, etc.) should be accounted for independently from in-house services, for clarity in profit-sharing and vendor payments.\n    •    Department-Wise Accounting:\n    •    Revenue and expenses should be segregated by department (e.g., OPD, IPD, Diagnostics, Pharmacy, Dental, Cataract) for detailed performance analysis.\n    •    Overall Financial Reporting:\n    •    A consolidated profit/loss report should be available to understand overall business health.\n    •    Break-Even & Asset-Inclusive Accounting:\n    •    A specialized accounting module that includes:\n    •    Asset tracking (e.g., equipment, machinery)\n    •    Depreciation calculation\n    •    Return on Investment (ROI)\n    •    Break-even analysis by factoring in capital expenses and fixed costs"
